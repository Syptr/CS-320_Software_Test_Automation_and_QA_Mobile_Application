# CS-320_Project_One_Mobile_Application
Mobile application to exhibit skills in testing and quality assurance using JUnit5.

#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
	I ensure that my code, program, and software are functional and secure by adhering to current industry standards. For each project, I make sure that my code is developed in line with the defined user requirements. I am able to verify that those needs are met, and secure, through testing.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
	To incorporate a user’s needs into the program, I make sure I fully understand what it is they are asking for. This understanding is important so to avoid any costly reworks later. Once established, these needs are implemented in the program just as they have been asked – no more, no less. The behavior must match what the user expects.
  
#How do I apporach designing software?
	 I strive to write code that is consistently clean, functional, and secure. This course has improved my approach to designing software as I have integrated the perspective of a quality assurance engineer. I make sure to write code that accounts for as many inputs and scenarios as possible. This is important because an error as early as design can result in failure later.
